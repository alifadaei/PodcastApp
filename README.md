# Podcastapp
This is the app I developed for my mother (Fatemeh)! as her favorite Religious trainer podcasts App (RTPA) :) 
leading to 4000 lines of pure js,css and html code!ðŸ˜œ

# How to?
At first you click start to choose subjects or click continue button to continue where you left off.
then you will see bearutiful tiles of years to click and then subjects and a more beautiful player app based on howler.js will touch your eyes!
enjoy!
